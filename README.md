# CDC-BRFSS-Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-
Analysis of the correlation between adult obesity rates and physical activity using the CDC BRFSS dataset, with Python code for data filtering, visualization, and statistical interpretation.
# CDC BRFSS: Obesity & Physical Activity Correlation Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between adult obesity rates and physical activity rates using the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The analysis is performed in Python with Google Colab and includes data cleaning, filtering, visualization (histograms, scatter plots), and Pearson correlation calculation.

## Project Features

- Load and preprocess the CDC BRFSS dataset (CSV format)
- Filter data by year and state (e.g., California, 2015)
- Visualize distributions of obesity and physical activity rates
- Analyze the linear correlation between the two variables using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient
- Interpret results and trends at national and state levels

## How to Run

1. Download the BRFSS dataset (CSV) from the [CDC Data Portal](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system).
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter.
3. Upload the CSV file to your Colab session.
4. Follow the notebook step by step. You can modify the filters for year/state as needed.
5. Review the generated visualizations and correlation results.

## Example Results

- Histograms of obesity and physical activity rates across states/years
- Scatter plots showing the relationship between variables
- Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value for the selected group(s)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
